    "This section defines the end-to-end modeling pipeline and performs automated hyperparameter tuning using `RandomizedSearchCV`. We first construct a Scikit-Learn `Pipeline` consisting of two main steps: a `StandardScaler` and an `XGBRegressor`. The scaler standardizes all numeric features so they are on comparable magnitude, which is particularly important because our dataset combines structured variables and PCA-compressed image features that exist on very different scales. XGBoost (XGBRegressor) is chosen as the core regression model because it performs exceptionally well on structured tabular data, models complex non-linear relationships, handles missing values gracefully, and is robust to overfitting when appropriately regularized. We configure XGBoost to use the histogram tree method for faster training, a relatively large number of trees, RMSE as the evaluation metric, and a fixed random seed to ensure reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of manually tuning hyperparameters, we define a controlled search space covering the most influential parameters such as learning rate, tree depth, regularization penalties, and sampling ratios. These parameters determine how complex, flexible, and regularized the model becomes. To efficiently explore this space, we use `RandomizedSearchCV`, which randomly samples 40 parameter combinations and evaluates each using 3-fold cross-validation. This strikes a balance between computational cost and tuning quality. RMSE is used as the scoring metric to align tuning with the final evaluation objective. The search also runs in parallel across all available CPU cores for speed and uses a fixed random seed so experiments can be reproduced."
